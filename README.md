# Math462
These are Projects I've built for a class I'm taking called Math462 at Claremont Graduate University

I've uploaded several Machine learning projects that I worked on for this class.

I closely followed Aurelien Geron's “Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems”; 3d Edition to get a high level understanding of the deep relationship between theoretical mathematics and its applied forms in modular machine learning. 

Machine learning is a rapidly growing field that is concerned with finding patterns in data. It is responsible for tremendous advances in technology, from personalized product recommendations to speech recognition in cell phones. This set of projects I have done covers theoretical foundations, algorithms, and methodologies for machine learning, emphasizing the role of probability and optimization and exploring a variety of real-world applications. These programming projects include - understanding and training of diffusion nets, flow guided nets, transformers. 

Through the class I learnt how to apply powerful machine learning techniques to solve novel problems. 

All my coding was done in Python.
